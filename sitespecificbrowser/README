Site Specific Browser Prototype
===============================

This is a prototype site-specific browser. Current features:

- Full isolation of the site-specific browser from your normal browser.

- Launches your default browser when you try to navigate outside the current
  web app.

- Not much else!

Stuff to Configure per-webapp
=============================

- Icon
- Window title
- Base URL
- White list of allowed navigation URLs
- Bookmarklets (Action name -> js code)
  The js code would be executed in the context of the current page.
- Fluid offers a few things worth considering:
  - Greasemonkey style user-scripts
  - Notification integration
  - More details http://fluidapp.com/developer/
- login credentials, how to authorize in a webapp
