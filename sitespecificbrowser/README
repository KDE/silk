Site Specific Browser Prototype
===============================

This is a prototype site-specific browser. Current features:

- Full isolation of the site-specific browser from your normal browser.

- Launches your default browser when you try to navigate outside the current
  web app.

- Not much else!

Stuff to Configure per-webapp
=============================

- Icon
- Window title
- Base URL
- White list of allowed navigation URLs
- Bookmarklets (Action name -> js code)
  The js code would be executed in the context of the current page.
- Fluid offers a few things worth considering:
  - Greasemonkey style user-scripts
  - Notification integration
  - More details http://fluidapp.com/developer/
- login credentials, how to authorize in a webapp
- toolbar


= Creating a new webapp =

WebApps consist of configuration settings and Actions. The settings for a webapp are read from a .desktop file.

Usually, a webapp will create on, two or more desktop files:

(1) A .desktop file to start the webapp, for example from the Menu and from Krunner:
    - Needs to be of type Application
    - Should have the webapps name, and comment
    - An Icon for the webapp

    A file could look like this:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=ReviewBoard
Comment=KDE's ReviewBoard Instance
Exec=sitespecificbrowser reviewboard
Icon=kstars
Type=Application

(2) A .desktop file describing the plugin, holding site-specific settings:
    - Has to be of Type=Service
    - startUrl, AllowedBases
    - KPluginInfo metadata, most importantly: X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name, which is used as parameter to sitespecificbrowser
    - config options, starting with: X-Silk-
      (These config options are defined in services/silk-webapp.desktop, which is the ServiceType for Silk/Webapp

The plugin .desktop file typically looks like:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Review Board
Comment=KDE's ReviewBoard Instance
Icon=kstars
Type=Service

X-KDE-ServiceTypes=Silk/WebApp

X-KDE-PluginInfo-Author=Sebastian KÃ¼gler
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Email=sebas@kde.org
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name=reviewboard
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Version=0.01
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Website=http://kde.org/
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Category=Development
X-KDE-PluginInfo-License=GPL
X-KDE-PluginInfo-EnabledByDefault=true

X-Silk-StartUrl=http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/
X-Silk-AllowedBases=http://reviewboard.kde.org/

(2) Zero, one or more Actions
    - Actions apply to a specific site
    - You need one .desktop file per action, containing options for triggering and enabling the Action
