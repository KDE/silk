==========================================

This is a prototype site-specific browser.

Current features:

- Full isolation of the site-specific browser from your normal browser. (Selkie runs in its own process)
- Appearance as first class standalone application
- Launches your default browser when you try to navigate outside the current
  web app.
- Site-specific actions that can be shown or hidden, based on the URL.
- Actions injecting javascript into the page
- Support for Greasemonkey scripts in progress
- Not much else!
