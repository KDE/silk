 The Web is Great
 
 - easy deployment
 - your data everywhere
 
 
 
 The Web Sucks
 
 - UI independance of the web (visual, input)
 - Offline -> Computer == Brick
 - JavaScript in Web Browser != Bling
 - The web has little personal context
 - For every click on a link, 2MB of I/O are happening
 
 
 We want the Web's Data and Services, Not the Web's UI
 
 
 
 How?
 
 
 Building a New User Interface for the Web
 
 - optimize content for the device (screen, input)
 - Coherent Theming
 - Improved development platform (not bound to JavaScript and AJAX, but FRIENDLY to those developers)
 - libraries with script-based plugins (updatable via online-services)
 - Geolocation and (more general) context



 
 
 
 
  
- a webkit-based Konqueror 




- libweb 




- Silk integration for existing technologies (digikam's 




- applications and applets integrating web content 




- new concepts of remixing content from the web




Not Starting at Zero:

- Wikipedia Runner
- microblogging
- Youtube dataengine
- opendesktop (libocs, dataengine)
- akonadi for personal data and caching
- sitespecificbrowser




Demos:

- ssb
- wikipedia runner

Why Silk? 
(Spider)webs are made of it.


- direct people to not talk to the media about it
- spread inside the development community
